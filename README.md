## Setup Linux

To be able to run it you have to open the terminal in the folder and type:

```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main.py
```

if you don't have the electronics you can still use it! When the terminal asks you to write a serial port, write anything and it will work, it will display random data. (but the text bug remains ;v).

## Setup Windows

Open CMD or PowerShell in the folder and type:

```
> virtualenv env
> \env\Scripts\activate.bat
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python main.py
```
